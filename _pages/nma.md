---


The Romanian National Meteorological Administration provides warnings for the public and the disaster management authorities in case of severe weather phenomena, and also being a supplier of scientific and technical services and a competent and reliable partner for public and private entities. The Romanian NMA is actively involved in national and international research projects, and education and training respectively. Romania is currently a Cooperating State to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), member of the EUMETNET’s radar programme OPERA, and starting with 2010, a full Member State of the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). Among NMA’s primary objectives is the constant work of upgrading real-time detection capabilities, and facilitating the exchange of data at local, regional and global levels.

The NMA research team involved in the WeaMyL project is multidisciplinary, with expertise in severe weather research, radar and satellite meteorology and data processing and analysis, weather forecasting, and climate research and services. Romanian NMA team includes:
