<p align="justify"><small>The Romanian National Meteorological Administration provides warnings for the public and the disaster management authorities in case of severe weather phenomena, and also being a supplier of scientific and technical services and a competent and reliable partner for public and private entities. The Romanian NMA is actively involved in national and international research projects, and education and training respectively. Romania is currently a Cooperating State to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), member of the EUMETNET’s radar programme OPERA, and starting with 2010, a full Member State of the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). Among NMA’s primary objectives is the constant work of upgrading real-time detection capabilities, and facilitating the exchange of data at local, regional and global levels.</small></p>
